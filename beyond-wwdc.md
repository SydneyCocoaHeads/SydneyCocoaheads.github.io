We like to do something a little bit special around WWDC time. The Sydney CocoaHeads event for June 2023 will be a partnership with Apple, with a focus on the announcements at this year's WWDC.

We'll be joined by a number of special guests for a panel discussion on all things WWDC - some of whom were on the ground at Apple Park for the all-important keynote day and/or had their products featured in the WWDC keynote and SotU:

- Matt Hall - Co Founder of Hipster Whale

- Quentin Zervaas - Founder of Crunchy Bagel

- Numa Bertron - Co-founder and CTO of JigSpace

- Vaishnavi Deshmukh

- Craig Phillips

- Sam Jarman

The event will be hosted on the evening of 15th June 2023 at Mantel Group. Details and RSVP can be found on Meetup at [this link](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/sydneycocoaheads/events/293545440/).
