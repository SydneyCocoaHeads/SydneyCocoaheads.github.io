We like to do something a little bit special around WWDC time. The Sydney CocoaHeads event for June 2023 will be a partnership with Apple, with a focus on WWDC-related content. 

The event will be hosted on the evening of 15th June 2023 at Mantel Group, and can be found on Meetup at [this link](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/sydneycocoaheads/events/293545440/).

Details to come. In the meantime, why not [check out the special event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgJrtDtDiS4) we hosted last WWDC?
