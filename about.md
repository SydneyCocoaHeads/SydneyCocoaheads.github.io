CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computerâ€™s Cocoa
Framework for programming on iOS and MacOS X. During monthly meetings,
members present on their projects and offer tutorials on various
programming topics.

Sydney CocoaHeads meets on the THIRD Thursday of every month in the
Sydney CBD. Check monthly announcements for the exact location.

We have a [Meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/sydneycocoaheads/)
