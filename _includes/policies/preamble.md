Welcome to Sydney CocoaHeads! For seven years we've been a community
of software developers, focused on Apple platforms. Of course when we
started in 2008 there was only one shipping Apple platform for
developers (unless you count iPod games :).

In that time we've grown from attendees that you can count on one hand
to three digit numbers, mirroring the growth globally in the Apple
developer community. Our Australian CocoaHeads meetups have become
some of the largest in the world (in the US, Europe and other
continents growth tends to show in many smaller regional groups).

CocoaHeads, here and globally, is a wonderful collection of people
from all sorts of technical backgrounds and all different parts of the
globe. I want to ensure that we remain strong, fun, technically
relevant, safe and inclusive. I hope we can not only be these things
for ourselves but also as an example for other younger meetups. We are
fortunate to have Apple setting such a great example, but our culture
is our responsibility.

All our speakers, attendees, and anyone else taking part in CocoaHeads
activities are expected to familiarise themselves with these
policies. While these policies are open to discussion and change over
time, attendance at any CocoaHeads event implies that you are willing
to abide by the policies as in place at that time.

While the precise policies are mostly based on those of other groups
(see credits below), I have tried to capture the existing culture and
vibe of Sydney CocoaHeads. These policies are, of course, open to
change over time. I am not the owner of Sydney CocoaHeads, merely the
custodian. We do not even have formal membership, it is owned by
you. Anyone who is a regular attendee can choose to be involved to the
extent they wish.

It's been an exciting seven years, but I can't wait to see what
comes next!
