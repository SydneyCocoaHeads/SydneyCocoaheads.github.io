Values
======

This document sets out our values. We want new people who come into
our community to understand our values and know that the people they
will meet agree to abide with these values.

Professionalism
---------------

While we are a community of people in many different ways, often
including friendship, it is also a professional community.  People
should be happy and comfortable to treat it as part of their
professional life as well as, hopefully, their personal life. Everyone
should feel completely comfortable to invite colleagues and friends to
any of our meetings. In addition, we need to respect that the venues
that host us are places people work, including some attendees.

Respect
-------

We value respect for people, for community, and for society. This
includes respect for the opinions, ideals and choices of others, for
the communities which we create and participate in, and for society as
a whole. It is vital that while we uphold our ideals, we respect the
ideals of others. We obey lawful restrictions placed upon us, for
example licensing and copyright law, to the best of our ability.

Fun
---

At Sydney CocoaHeads we have never been accused of taking ourselves
too seriously. Professionalism does not exclude having fun and being a
little bit silly. We are at our best when we are ourselves, but always
keeping in mind the above respect for others.
