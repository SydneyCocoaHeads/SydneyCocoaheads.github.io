Reporting
=========

Any time that you feel any policies, values, or standards of
CocoaHeads are being broken, or any other conduct of speakers or
attendees is distressing to you, you should always feel comfortable to
report it, knowing that you will be taken seriously, and that it will
be appropriately investigated and dealt with. There are a few
different avenues for reporting.

* Personally, to any member of the organising committee. Currently the
  organising committee consists of only Mark Aufflick :) You can
  contact me at <mark@aufflick.com>.
* Personally, to any member of the Values and Diversity
  committee. These people are yet to be announced, and in the mean
  time, you can contact the reporting mentors, who are Fiona Chan
  <fiona@fionachan.net> and Manuel Chakravarty <mchakravarty@me.com>.
* Anonymously, at
  <https://sydneycocoaheads.wufoo.com/forms/sydney-cocoaheads-values-and-standards-reporting/>.
  Anonymous reports will go to all members of the organising committee
  and Values and Diversity committee.
   
All complaints made in any of these ways will remain confidential, be
taken seriously, investigated, and dealt with appropriately.

Personal reports are always much better since there is only so much
investigation that can be done without the ability to speak to the
reporting party. When you report personally to any of the above
people, please make sure you tell them if there is anyone specifically
you do not want them to speak to about the issue. Normally the person
you report to will discuss the report with other team members and/or
the reporting mentors.

Enforcement
===========

Together with advice from the Values and Diversity committee, the
organisers of Sydney CocoaHeads may take any or all of the following
measures:

* The alleged offender may be asked to stop or modify their behaviour
* The alleged offender may be warned that enforcement action will be
  taken if the behaviour continues
* The alleged offender may be asked to immediately leave the venue
  and/or be prohibited from continuing to attend the event
* The incident may be reported to the appropriate authorities
* Sydney CocoaHeads is aware of the responsibility required to ensure
  a successful and productive meetup. If an incident occurs, Sydney
  CocoaHeads will formally apologise to those affected. A record of
  the incident will be kept and future measures will be taken to
  ensure that it does not happen again
