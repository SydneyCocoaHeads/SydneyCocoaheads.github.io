At Sydney CocoaHeads we too are making inclusion and diversity a
priority. We're introducing more open and inclusive processes, and
specific programs to encourage all kinds of first time speakers. We
want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever
your background, we welcome you. A diverse community where people
treat each other with respect has more potential contributors and more
sources for ideas.

Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to
make it all-inclusive, we recognise that there are specific attributes
that are used to discriminate against people. In alphabetical order,
some of these attributes include (but are not limited to): age,
culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin,
physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people
regardless of the values of these or other attributes.

[The Diversity Paradox](http://issuu.com/the-bteam/docs/the-diversity-paradox-150114)
by Rich Lesser, the CEO of The Boston Consulting Group. You can read
their summary of diversity research in
[Diversity: Bringing the business case to life](http://issuu.com/the-bteam/docs/the-business-case-for-diversity-150)
which, for those who need convincing, empirically shows that diversity
and inclusion leads to: better financial performance; better business
performance and reputation; better customer connections and market
share; better innovation and group performance; and better and broader
talent.
