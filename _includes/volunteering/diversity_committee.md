Diversity Committee
===================

I'm leaving the best for last. I'm really excited about what we can accomplish with CocoaHeads in the future, and that's going to need all kinds of people involved. I discussed this at some length in the February meetup (if you missed that you should read up on our new [policies]({{ "/policies" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) where you'll find more about this).

We're putting together a small group of people to do two things. One is to help design and put together events that help promote diversity in CocoaHeads, the first being the speaker training I alluded to in February. We will have sponsorship of real dollars to help do something really great. The other is to be point-people for anyone who has a concern related to Code of Conduct, Values or Diversity.

I am placing constraints on who we will consider for this group.

Of course we will be looking for diversity of all kinds—to use the words of our [Diversity policy]({{ "/policies/#diversity" | prepend: site.baseurl }}),

> In alphabetical order, some of these attributes include (but are not limited to): age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people regardless of the values of these or other attributes.

The other constraint is that we won't be considering anyone who is "CocoaHeads establishment". That might seem a bit odd, but the whole point here is to get new and fresh ideas, otherwise I'd just ask myself :)

With a few people involved this shouldn't actually be too much work. In addition, you'll have Fiona Chan, Manuel Chakravarty and myself for advice.

I am, of course, a programmer so please forgive my use of the word *constraint* ;) If you feel any kind of urge to be involved in this, or have any questions, please email me. No idea or question is silly.
