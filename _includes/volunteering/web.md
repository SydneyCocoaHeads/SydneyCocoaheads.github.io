Web
===

I'd like to improve the way the meetup.com entry is embedded in the web page, if someone who loves JavaScript wants to make our own widget using the meetup api's that would be awesome! (I may have developed a dynamic html/javascript web store in 1997, but that doesn't mean I have to like it :) It may turn out it can't be done because the APIs always require a key or something, in which case we can always spin up a simple heroku end point or something. The Jekyll/github/vimeo publishing can probably use some tweaks along the way.

Opportunity
-----------

Somebody to look into the above meetup api idea and also do any other odd web/jekyll/etc coding things that come up.
