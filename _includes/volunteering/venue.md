Welcoming
=========

Turning up at a CocoaHeads with around 100 people, many of whom already know each other, is daunting for anybody, and a completely impossible challenge for many. One way we can improve that, an approach that is proven in other commercial and non-commercial environments, is to have official greeters. Two people at the bottom of the lifts and two people just inside the doors to notice and connect with new people would be amazing.

If we had a roster of people doing this we can reduce the load on each person to being a greeter once every few months. As a plus, as a greeter you have a great opportunity to get to know more people too :)

Venue
=====

Atlassian gracefully supply us with a place to meet as well as food and drink each month. There are still some things we need to do however. Each month ahead of time we contact Atlassian, confirm the meetup date and give them a forecast of our RSVP numbers. On the night we usually need to configure the room (setting out chairs, drink tubs, ice, drinks etc.) which for 100 chairs takes a little while. Then we need to make sure things are packed down and cleaned up before the last person leaves.

Opportunity
-----------

I'd love it if somebody would be willing to own this responsibility. Every month there are always people willing to lend a hand with chairs etc. but it would be great if someone could take care of communicating with Atlassian and then making sure there are a few people coming to help with the setup. If you love lists you might even like to make a roster ;)
