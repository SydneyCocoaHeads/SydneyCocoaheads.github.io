Communications
==============

Each month a bunch of communications go out. I've streamlined things somewhat, but there are still announcements to send via email and meetup, speakers to re-confirm, videos (hopefully :) to publish.

Opportunity
-----------

Somebody to be the "communication czar" and ensure that announcements, speaker emails etc. are done on a timely basis (ie. better than me). We did have somebody do exactly this role a year or so ago and it was very effective.
