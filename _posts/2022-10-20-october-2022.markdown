## CocoaHeads October 2022!

We had two exciting talks in October. Please note that Craig's talk wasn't recorded and so the stream is shorter than usual.

🔐 Passkeys and the Relying Party - Craig Pearson, IBM Security
// Obtain this from the server.
In this presentation we look at the role of the relying party; its the glue to implement an end-2-end sign up and sign in experience with Passkeys.

🕶 AR Glasses: Gesture Controls - Jan Plešek
