Manuel Chakravarty is back, explaining functional programming in Swift. Find out why Swift may be the most influential functional language. Learn how type-driven design allows us to write less tests without a loss of confidence in our code, through a series of examples, drawn from Manuel's experience of developing one of the first Swift-based applications published in the Mac App Store.

Recorded at Sydney Cocoaheads October 2016.
