## CocoaHeads May 2023!

We had two great talks in May, but please note that due to technical difficulties, only one was recorded and is available on YouTube.

🛠️ Untitled Dev Tools Talk (Amy Delves)

🧑‍💻 Writing API’s using Swift Lambda (Stewart Thomson)

We'll be back in June with our WWDC spectacular event. Stay tuned to the Meetup page for details.
