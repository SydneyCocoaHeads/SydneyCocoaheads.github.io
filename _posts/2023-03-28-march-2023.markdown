## CocoaHeads March 2023 (Part 2)!

We held a special additional event in March, and were lucky enough to have a couple of great talks again:

ðŸ“² Offline first & automatic data synchronisations for your web and mobile applications (SÃ©bastien Stormacq)
ðŸ’» Introduction to Backend Development (Sam Jarman)

Please note this was the second of two events in March 2023.
