## CocoaHeads October 2023!

(Sorry for the audio issues at the start and end of the stream.)

October was a busy month with three talks:

🔐 The state of the user authentication. Login with Apple, FIDO, passcode and beyond - Jack Rudenko

📲 Localizing Screenshots with Fastlane - Christian Mitteldorf

🛠️ Swift Result Builders - Zach Simone

A recording of the event is now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVPahIoJKw4).
_Again, sorry for the audio issues. The audio is only good for Jack and Christian's talks – skip to those._
