## CocoaHeads May 2024!

Two great talks this month:
🗺️ Amy Delves on MapKit and SwiftUI: "Been a round the world a couple of times or maybe more"
📲 Daniel MacLaughlin on "Leveraging Managed App Config"

A recording of the event is now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRRkMCzgAfQ).
