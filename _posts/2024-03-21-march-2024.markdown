## CocoaHeads March 2024!

It was an action-packed agenda for this month's meetup!

First up, we have Nicole Liu speaking about "100 Days of Swift UI - Learning Stories". 

Following, we have a panel discussion about what it's like to build and ship an app for the Apple Vision Pro featuring Oliver Weidlich, Stuart Varrall, and Adrian Sch√∂nig.

A recording of the event is now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e53ZLKfrAdM).
