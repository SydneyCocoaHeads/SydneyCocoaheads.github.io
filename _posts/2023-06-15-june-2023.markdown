## CocoaHeads June 2023 - "Beyond WWDC"!

Our special "Beyond WWDC" event took place again this year, in partnership with Apple, with a focus on the announcements at this yearâ€™s WWDC.

We were joined by a fantastic lineup for a panel discussion, with a focus on all things WWDC, and especially Vision Pro and visionOS. Some of the panel were on the ground at Apple Park for the all-important keynote day and/or had their products featured in the WWDC keynote and SotU:

- Matt Hall - Co Founder of Hipster Whale

- Quentin Zervaas - Founder of Crunchy Bagel

- Numa Bertron - Co-founder and CTO of JigSpace

- Craig Phillips

- Sam Jarman

A recording of the event is now [available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/8jQoIPIcfJE).
