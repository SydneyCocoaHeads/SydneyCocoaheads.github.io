## CocoaHeads February 2023!

CocoaHeads is back with its first event of 2023 - and it's sure to be a good one! 

Our talks this month are:

• Accessibility Must Haves (Dan)

• Apple Frameworks - beyond WWDC presentations (Mike Pyrka)
Each year Apple presents new exciting technologies that developers can adapt to their apps. How can we know if a given framework meets our needs and what to do in case of unexpected problems?
